# MineSweeper
Classic Mine Sweeper<br>
This is a classic minesweeper we all know from old versions of Windows, with refreshed graphics
.<br> 
I created this using Java Swing, but i already started migrating to JavaFx.<br> 
For people who would like to play game looking as the classical one I'm also planning to introduce themes.
