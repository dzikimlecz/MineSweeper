# MineSweeper
This is a classic minesweeper we all know from old versions of Windows, with refreshed graphics
.<br> 
Created using JavaFx but on the branch <code>swing</code> there is discontinued version created in Swing. (looks more old-fashioned)<br> 
For people who would like to play game looking as the classical one I'm also planning to introduce such theme.
